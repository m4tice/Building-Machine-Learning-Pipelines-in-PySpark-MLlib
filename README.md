# Building-Machine-Learning-Pipelines-in-PySpark-MLlib
A guided project of Coursera: Building ML pipelines using PySpark. The tasks include:

1. Install Spark, load required libraries, set environment variables, initiate Spark, load file  
2. Describe and clean dataset  
3. Create a Random Forest pipeline to predict car prices  
4. Create a cross validator for hyperparameter tuning  
5. Train model and predict test set car prices  
6. Evaluate modelâ€™s performance via several metrics
